              To use our analysis platform you simply create an account on this site. We will provide you a git repository and you can work with it as usual.
              For each registered Repository, each commit will trigger our analysis. We will copy your repositories, so your configuration and deployment files stay intact.
              Furthermore no extra settings in your repository are needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Independent to your Build- and Deploymentpipeline we perform the analysis for you, according to your specifications. Finally you will get notified with a summarised report via email. The full report can be accessed via our Web-Interface, including a history.
